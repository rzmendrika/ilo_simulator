							A calculation simulator is an online service made available to a user to enable them to calculate the results (taxes, social benefits, etc.) corresponding to their particular situation.

							<br>
							The results are calculated on the basis of data supplied by the user, reference data (e.g. amount of a tax) and business rules reflecting the current legislation in the field of simulation.
